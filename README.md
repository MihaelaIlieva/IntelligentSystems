##### FrogLeap - switch the positions of all the frogs, so that all n ">" frogs are on the right and all n "<" frogs are on the left.
##### SlidingPuzzle - given an order of numbers and position for the blank piece the algorithm gives optimal solution. Used A* algorithm with Manhattan distance for heuristic.
##### NQueens - places n queens on NxN chess board so no two queens attack each other. Used Min conflicts algorithm.
##### FasterNQueens - optimisation of NQueens using 1d arrays for managing conflicts faster and easier.
##### Knapsack - given a knapsack's maximum capacity for weight and number of objects, as well as the given objects' properties, prints the maximum weight it can take from those objects. Used Genetic algorithm with two-point crossover and swap mutation.
##### TicTacToe - the user can start or choose the machine to start and play TicTacToe against it. Used Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and depth checking for optimisation.
##### NaiveBayesClassifier - based on given dataset classifies test data. Used Naive Bayes Classifier (biggest probability) with Laplase Smoothing and logarithms for zero-based problems.
##### kMeans - given a dataset of points and number of clusters the task gives us the dataset clusterised. Used kMeans and kMeans++ for comparison of kMeans.
